<h1>p27.eu Advertising Guidelines</h1>

<p>[<a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>]</p>

<p> You may advertise on p27.eu.  Why you would do so is
    somewhat different than advertising on other sites, so please
    do read these guidelines.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p><ul>
    <li> Up to three words, about 20 characters max</li>
    <li> This is on the root page only</li>
    <li> Your ad will appear next to the FAQ</li>
    <li> Your ad will only appear for a couple seconds, just like the FAQ link.
	It increases the mystery, it's good.</li>
    <li> Your ad doesn't get me in trouble or cause me serious hassle</li>
    <li> If your content is NSFW, you link through an intermediate page
	that gives fair warning and explanation</li>
</ul></li></p>

<h2>Cost</h2>

<p>The cost is 50 â‚¬ per day for up to three words.  For
    longer ads, we can come to some agreement.  We are interested in
    the page loading quickly and staying quite simple.  (Yes, our SVG
    is too heavy.  We're open to help fixing that.)</p>

<h2>Details</h2>

<p>You may only advertise on the <a href="index.html">root page</a>.
    </p>

<p>Since there is no substantive content on the root page, We can't
    help you target your advertisement to your audience.  We
    suspect the potential interest is precisely the fact that you
    would be paying to reach an unknown audience, for example to
    publicise a new product launch.</p>

<p> In addition, we require that neither the words of your ad nor
    the initial page to which they jump should be obviously
    illegal in France, the United Kingdom, or the United States.
    They should also not be likely to offend too seriously in
    those countries.  (So please don't ask us to link to a cartoon
    of Mohammad or something that will cause us to be hassled,
    even if we take no personal position on your content.)</p>

<p>
    If you want to link through to something questionable or NSFW
    (not safe for work), please link through an intermediate page
    which provides clear and adequate warning of what's about to
    happen (in English) and does not redirect for at least five
    seconds.  That should be enough to let people who don't want
    to continue on to abort.</p>

<p> The pricing may vary with time and is designed to make sponsored
    links the exception and not the rule.  (That simplifies my life
    for now and increases the effect of your advertisement.)  It is
    the same price in euro and pound sterling and 50% more in USD.
    If you are paying in Europe, We would prefer payment by bank
    (SEPA) transfer if possible.  Otherwise, we can use paypal.</p>

<p> I am not currently planning on automating this service (beyond
    using cron to swap in your ad and pull it out again).  If you are
    interested in advertising, please email me, username "jeff".
    Please don't spam me.  Please use a clear subject.  Please contact
    me in advance of when you want your ad to run so that we have time
    to handle payment and set up the page.</p>

<p>
    If you send me mail that does not appear to be constructive or
    serious, I may simply ignore it (and flag it as spam for my
    spam filter to handle next time).</p>

<p>
    I am open to constructive feedback on the advertising program.
    My purpose is to cover my (miniscule) costs of running the
    site.  If I buy myself some good chocolate out of it, that's a
    nice plus.</p>
