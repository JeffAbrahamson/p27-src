<h2>p27.eu Availability Guidelines</h2>

<h4>p27.eu is <u>not</u> for sale</h4>


<p>We do use p27.eu. We understand that those who are not
    technically inclined nor in the know may not see
    that. That's ok. We don't think any less of those who
    don't know our personal business.</p>

<p>Actually, you could buy it, but the price is 1.5 Mâ‚¬.  For most
    people, that's maybe equivalent to not being for sale.  That's
    ok.</p>


<p><b>1.  Advertising.</b>  You may place a text ad on the
    main purple page (<a
href="https://www.p27.eu/index.html">https://www.p27.eu/index.html</a>).
    See the <a
    href="advertise.html">advertising</a> page for full
    details.
</p>

<p>The main page currently redirects to blank purple after 2
    seconds.  You may increase the delay time for a daily
    price that is 20% of your ad price times the square of the
    number of seconds you wish to add.</p>
